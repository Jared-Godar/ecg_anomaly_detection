## About the project

The improvement in availability and reduction in cost of a variety of sensors have lead to an increased need for automatic signal processing and analysis of the increased data generated.

This project will look at detecting anomalies in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. 

Until recently, most ECGs were performed in a clinical setting. They were ordered by a healthcare professional and one was on hand to analyze and interpret the results.

Now, many consumer wearable devices are able to measure ECGs outside of a clinical setting. It is important to be able to quickly and accurately determine abnormalities in these measurements in an automated manner.

### Project goals

The goal of this project is to detect anomalies in ECG measurements.

It is necessary to detect these anomalies in an automated way in order to maximize the benefit
